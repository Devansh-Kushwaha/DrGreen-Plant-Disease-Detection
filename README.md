## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Devansh-Kushwaha/DrGreen-Plant-Disease-Detection.git
cd DrGreen-Plant-Disease-Detection
```

---

## 🧠 Backend Setup (Django)

### 🔧 Install Dependencies

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### ⚙️ Run Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### ▶️ Start the Django Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be live at:  
👉 `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

---

## 🎨 Frontend Setup (React)

Open a new terminal window/tab and navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

### ▶️ Start React App

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at:  
👉 `http://localhost:5173/` (or the port shown in terminal)

---

## 🧪 Using the Application

1. Upload an image of a plant leaf
2. The backend will process the image and run the ML model
3. Results will be displayed on the frontend with the predicted disease (if any)
